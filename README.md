# codepath-python README

'What is the path to this nested dictionary element?'

If you ask youself this question a lot, you may be in GIS and/or this extension may be useful.

## You can only do one thing

`Ctrl + Shift + P` and run the `WhereAmI` command, with your cursor on a nested dictionary element.

## I want to do other things?

Make an issue on GitHub describing the output you want, this could be extended quite a bit.

## Requirements
Python.

## Extension Settings
This extension aspires to but does not yet contribute the following settings:

* `codepath-python.pythonPath`: override `python.pythonPath`. Uses `python` if both undefined.

## Known Issues

Tests? What are tests?
A lot of paths won't work, dict-only only mostly for this first demo.

## Release Notes

### 0.0.1

Basic end-to-end working for Dicts. PoC, just publishing for experience with VS Code extensions.
